## Comments

Made the ricotta by boiling 2 litres of milk and the adding juice of 2 lemons. 

Didn't have enough hazelnuts. Subsititued with ground almonds.

Baked in a bundt tin, red silicon. 

Makes a nice, rather wet cake. When cooled drizzled the top with the chocolate ganache and decorated with P&Es easter decorations. Added a packet of chocolate mini eggs into the centre. Becasue the cake was still warm, even after a few hours, the eggs crakced slightly and looked like they were hatching.
