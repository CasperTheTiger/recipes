| --- | 
| 175g sofetened butter |
| 175g caster sugar|
| 225g self raising flour|
| 50g ground almonds|
| 3 large eggs|

## Recipe
Preheat the oven to 160C fan. 

Grease and line a 18cm round cake tin. 

Put all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and mix until smooth. Do not over mix because this will develop the gluten in the flour. 

Bake for 1 hour. Testing at 45 mins. 

Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack. 

## Comments

You can subsitiute some of the white flour for brown.

If there is no self raising flour use plain flour and add 2 tsp of baking powder into the mixture before mixing. 

This can be used as a base for an upside-down cake with fruit if needed.
